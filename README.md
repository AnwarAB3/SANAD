# SANAD PV Design Review Platform

**SANAD (Smart Automated Network for Auditing and Design Compliance)** is an engineering-focused web platform designed to automate early-stage photovoltaic (PV) design reviews.

The system performs intelligent checks on submitted PV designs to detect technical risks, design inconsistencies, and regulatory gaps **before construction or procurement**.

---

##  Project Overview

SANAD provides an automated, location-aware PV design audit by combining:

* Site-specific climate data
* Manufacturer electrical parameters
* Engineering logic based on PV design standards

The platform helps engineers and decision-makers identify potential issues early, reducing redesign cost, safety risks, and approval delays.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Site-Based Climate Analysis

* Search and select project location
* Automatic retrieval of:

  * Current ambient temperature
  * Historical minimum temperature (last 10 years)
* Climate-aware electrical evaluation

### 2. Document Intake

* Upload **Single-Line Diagram (SLD)** (PDF)
* Upload **Bill of Materials (BoM)** (Excel)
* Automatic extraction of key electrical parameters

### 3. Engineering Review (Stage 2)

* **BoM vs SLD consistency check**

  * Detects mismatches in inverter voltage and string configuration
  * Visual status: MATCH / WARNING

* **Cold Weather Overvoltage Assessment**

  * Calculates string voltage at minimum temperature
  * Identifies inverter DC overvoltage risk
  * Generates mitigation recommendations

* **Saudi / IEC Standards Snapshot**

  * Highlights compliant checks
  * Lists gaps requiring engineering validation

### 4. Automated Report Generation

* One-click export of a professional **SANAD Design Review Report (PDF)**
* Includes:

  * Project information
  * Key electrical numbers
  * Risk summary
  * Compliance snapshot
  * Engineering recommendations

---

## Engineering Logic

SANAD applies industry-recognized PV engineering principles, including:

* Temperature-adjusted open-circuit voltage (Voc cold calculation)
* String sizing verification against inverter DC maximum limits
* Conservative design assumptions using historical climate data
* Best-effort SLD text extraction (with OCR readiness)

> Note: Scanned SLD drawings require OCR/Vision modules for full automation.
